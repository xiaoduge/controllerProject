    <h3 id="third-header">Service Providers</h3>
    <p>We use a third-party hosting service such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) to store system history data due to the following reasons: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>To store data collected;</li>
        <li>To relay data to your authorized email addresses via RephiLink APP;</li>
        <li>To perform related services by our service engineer, such as diagnose system status and issues when we receive service calls from you.</li>
    </ul>
